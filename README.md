Javascript Interaction :-

There are 4 javascript function included in my website
1) Typewriter function : This function implemented at the tagline of Campaign. To be honest, this is copy paste code from google with minor change in it.
2) Scroll to top function : This function implement to the button at the bottom right of the page. Its appear when user scroll certain point. When user click the button. It will bring the user to top of the page.
3) Change the Agreement Radio Button : This function implemented in the form where when the user change the value of amout or start date or end date. It will change the value in the agreement too. (P/S : User need to fill all the value first(4th function/interaction). After that when changing the value, user will see the change)
4) Agreement Radio Interaction : The last js interaction implemented is the user need to fill all the required input before they can check the agreement. If one or more input not filled yet, then the button is unclickable and the  agreement does not appear.
